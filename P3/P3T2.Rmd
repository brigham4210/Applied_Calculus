We will Find the Expected Value and Variance of each Stochastic Variable to Fit the Model in this task.

Here are the Expected Value and Variance of each Function that I got from the Mathematica:
![f0](C:\Users\brigh\Downloads\f0.png)
 For $f_0$, the expected value is $\frac{a+b}{2}$, and the variance is $\frac{(a-b)^2}{12}$ 
![f1](C:\Users\brigh\Downloads\f1.png)
 For $f_1$, the expected value is μ, and the variance is $σ^2$
![f2](C:\Users\brigh\Downloads\f2.png)
 For $f_2$, the expected value is $\frac{α}{β}$, and the variance is $\frac{α}{β^2}$
![f3](C:\Users\brigh\Downloads\f3.png)
 For $f_3$, the expected value is $\frac{1}{λ}$, and the variance is $\frac{1}{λ^2}$


Find the a & b of $f_0$:
$EV = 2.79164 = \frac{a+b}{2}$

$Var = 10.97915 = \frac{(a-b)^2}{12}$
The picture below is how we find the a & b

$\frac{a+b}{2}=EV$, $\frac{(b-a)^2}{12}=Var$
$b=2EV-a$, $\frac{(2EV-2a)^2}{12}=Var$
$a=\frac{\sqrt{12Var}-2EV}{-2} $


```{r}
EV <- 2.79164
V <- 10.97915

a<- (sqrt(12*V)-2*EV)/-2
b <- 2*EV - a
a
b
b-a
```
```{r}
f0 <- function(x,a,b){1/(b-a)}
library(data4soils)
Ng <- cfbp_fpjuliet$ng
hist(Ng, probability = TRUE,main = "Fitted distribution" ,breaks = 100)
f0 <- function(x,a,b){0*x+1/(b-a)}

x <- seq(0,20,2)
lines(x,f0(x,-2.947476,8.530756),col=2)
```

According to the code, we found that a = -2.947476, b = 8.530756
The best fitted model for f0: 
\begin{align*}
f_0(x;a,b) = \frac{1}{b-a} = \frac{1}{11.47823}
\end{align*}

This line is flat and it does not fit the plot at all. So this is not a good model

Find the λ of f3:
EV = 2.79164 = 1/λ
λ = 1/EV
```{r}
EV <- 2.79164
lambda <- 1 / EV
lambda
```
```{r}
library(data4soils)
Ng <- cfbp_fpjuliet$ng
hist(Ng, probability = TRUE,main = "Fitted exponential distribution", breaks = 100)
f3 <- function(x,l){l*exp(l*(-x))}
l <- 0.358
x <- seq(0,100,2)
lines(x,f3(x,l),col=2)
```

According to the code, we found that λ = 0.358
The best fitted model for f3: 
\begin{align*}
f_3(x;λ) = λe^{−λx} = 0.358e^{−0.358x}
\end{align*}

This line kinda follow the pattern. So this is a good model.
